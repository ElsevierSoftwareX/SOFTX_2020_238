# #### Actions
# - Feature request: do checkpointing when instruments are down
# - Feature request: need to hook up equivalent of "CAT 2" vetoes to online analysis when ready, and HW inj veto, etc.
# - Document the parameters in mkLLOIDmulti()
# - Check if bank ids are the same across different instruments
# - Feature request: Make time-frequency videos for interesting events
# - Inject signals of known, high SNR and measure loss
# - move the makesegmentsrcgate to before the matrix mixer, not in the current sum-of-squares control loop
# - Make conditional branches in the graph gray boxes
# - consider zero padding the beginning of jobs to get rid of mkdrop()
# - Decide how to properly normalize SNRs for incomplete filter segments (currently filters are not renormalized so the loss in SNR is bigger than might be expected)
# - Check and possibly fix the function that switches between time-domain and FFT convolution based on stride and number of samples
# - Consider if quality = 9 is right for downsampling (it should be plenty good, but maybe excessive?)
#
#
# #### Functions/classes not reviewed since they will be moved
# - DetectorData 
# - mkSPIIRmulti
# - mkSPIIRhoftToSnrSlices
# - mkLLOIDSnrSlicesToTimeSliceChisq
# - mkLLOIDSnrChisqToTriggers
