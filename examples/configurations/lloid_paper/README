Studies accuracy of LLOID filters with respect to nominal templates by
evaluating the dot product ("match") between the LLOID pipeline's impulse
respone and the time-reveresed templates.

The entire process is automated by a Makefile; you can generate all of the
results for the paper by running the command::

   $ make -j

Here are what the following scripts do:

./generate_templates
   Realizes nominal template bank as an array of FIR filter coefficients and
   writes the array as a flat binary file.

./compute_match
   Run a simplified version of the LLOID pipeline using a unit impulse as input.
   As output is produced, accumulate the dot product.  Finally, write the list
   of matches for all templates to a file for each time slice.

./computematchsink.c
   Source code for a special-purpose GStreamer element that is used in
   compute_match to evaluate the running dot products.

And here are the important data files that get generated by "make":

./libcomputematchsink.so
   Compiled and linked binary for 'computematchsink' element.

./hoft
   Mock aLIGO frames generated by gstlal_mock_data_server.  lalapps_tmpltbank
   is the only part of the process that requires frames.  (FIXME: could
   lalapps_tmpltbank have a PSD option so it doesn't require frames?)

./frame.cache
   Frame cache for frames in ./hoft.

./psd.xml
   PSD estimated with gstlal_referene_psd from frames in ./hoft.

./tmpltbank-pruned.xml
   Template placement generated by lalapps_tmpltbank, with duplicate templates
   (bug in lalapps_tmpltbank?) stripped.

./tmpltbank.xml
   Same as tmpltbank-pruned.xml, but only keeping templates for which
   1.1955 <= mchirp <= 1.2045.

./tmpltbank.bin
   Nominal template implementation generated by ./generate_templates.

./svd_0_99....out
   LLOID template bank design generated by gstlal_svd_bank with an svd
   tolerance encoded as a float with an _ in place of a decimal point.

./match_0_99..._0.out, ./match_0_99..._1.out, ...
   Outputs as lists of match for all templates.  Each file is a
   newline-separated list of floats; the i'th line is the match with the i'th
   template.  The 0_99... part of the filename records the SVD tolerance with
   the _ representing the decimal point.  The final underscore-separated
   integer records the ordinal number of the time slice.  For example, the
   files ending in _3.out are the accumulated dot products from the 0'th, 1'st,
   2'nd, and 3'rd time slices.
   
   By default, match is calculated for only the zeroth time slice.  A flag in
   the script compute_match turns the other time slices on or off.

./resample_match_0_0.out, ./resample_match_0_1.out, ...
   Outputs as lists of match for all templates, as above, but SVD tolerance
   is held constant at 0.999999 as 'quality' of the interpolator is varied.
   The first index denotes the 'quality' and the second index denotes the
   time slice.
