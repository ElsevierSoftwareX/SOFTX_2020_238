S6 Online Network Configuration
===============================

This directory contains all the files related to the online S6 detector network configuration.
The Makefile here will build all of the data files that are needed to launch the pipeline.
The Python script "network.py" constructs and runs the GStreamer pipeline itself.

To get started, build all of the data files by typing
$ make -j all

and then start the pipeline by typing
$ ./network.py -i H1 -i L1 -s 969333979 -e 969341179 --template-bank tmpltbank.xml.gz --output network.sqlite
