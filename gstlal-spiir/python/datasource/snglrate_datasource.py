	# filter upstream of the resampler to ensure that this is, infact,
	# *down*-sampling.  if the source time series has a lower sample
	# rate than the highest target sample rate the resampler will
	# become an upsampler, and the result will likely interact poorly
	# with the whitener as it tries to ampify the non-existant
	# high-frequency components, possibly adding significant numerical
	# noise to its output.  if you see errors about being unable to
	# negotiate a format from this stage in the pipeline, it is because
	# you are asking for output sample rates that are higher than the
	# sample rate of your data source.
