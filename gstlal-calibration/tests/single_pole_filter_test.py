# To implement your solution (once you have something that works), you will need to make changes around line 1717 and around line 2060 in gstlal_compute_strain.
# Quite possibly, you may need to make changes in the function starting at line 327 in gstlal_adaptivefirfilt.c.  There is already code in place to make a 2-tap filter for fcc (or an N - 1 tap filter for N zeros), but I have not tested it.  This is where Jolien's solution could go, if what's currently there is not correct.
# Also - just a warning - I just typed this testing script up, and it may have problems that you will need to debug.

	# Now, this needs to be used in the element lal_adaptivefirfilt to turn it into a FIR filter.
	# lal_adaptivefirfilt takes as inputs (in this order) zeros, poles, a complex factor containing gain and phase.

	# Now we must interleave these streams, since lal_adaptivefirfilt takes a single multi-channel stream of interleaved data.

	# update_samples tells it how often to send a new filter to the filtering element
	# minimize_filter_length must be True for it to use a 2-tap filter.  Otherwise, it makes a longer FIR filter using and iFFT from a frequency-domain model.
	# This will also write the filter coefficients to file.

	# Correct the 1/2-sample shift in timestamps by applying a linear-phase FIR filter

	# You could, for instance, compare this transfer function to what you expect, i.e., gain * (1 + i f / fcc), and plot the comparison in the frequency-domain.  I'm guessing there will be a fair amount of work involved in getting everything to work and getting the result correct.
