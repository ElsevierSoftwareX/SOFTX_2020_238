Writing elements in Python
==========================

GStreamer fully supports Python elements in all GStreamer-enabled applications.

Advantages:

* Develop elements in Python first, to get the logic right, then port them to C
  when time permits and performance demands its.

* Write less boilerplate code: it is easier to write a class in Python than in
  native C under glib/gobject.

* Avoid writing code to handle common error conditions (out of memory, failed to
  push tags, type mismatch, etc.).  PyGST checks return values generates
  exceptions.

* Take advantage of Python's powerful introspection, collection data types,
  string processing, and database handling within your elements.

* Create beautiful realtime plots.  Embed matplotlib code directly in elements
  to build interactive visualizations: spectrum analyzers, digital storage 
  oscilloscopes, pulse count analyzers, histograms -- whatever you can dream up!


Here is how it works:

1. GStreamer looks in each directory on the plugin path (a combination of 
   $GST_PLUGIN_PATH, $GST_PLUGIN_SYSTEM_PATH, ~/.gstreamer-0.10/plugins)
   for a subdirectory named "python".

2. For each "python" directory, it looks for all files ending in ".py".

3. For each ".py" file, it attempts to import that file as a module in a
   subinterpreter.

4. If successful, it looks for a module-level variable '__gstelementfactory__'.
   If it is defined, it should be a tuple consisting of the element name, 
   the rank for autoplugging, and the Python class that implements the element.
   This usually looks something like::
   
     __gstelementfactory__ = ('lal_foobarmux', gst.RANK_NONE, lal_foobarmux)

5. If this variable exists, then GStreamer registers the element.  It is now
   a card-carrying member of your plugin registry, and can be used in any
   context where elements can normally used: you can use it in gst-launch
   invocations, you can gst-inspect it, or even use it from any native C
   gstreamer application.


Caveats
-------

* All Pythonic elements are currently lumped under a single plugin, "python".
