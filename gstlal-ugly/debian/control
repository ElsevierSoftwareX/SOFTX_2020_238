Description: GStreamer version of LAL (ugly part)
 gstlal provides a suite of GStreamer elements that expose
 gravitational-wave data analysis tools from the LAL library for use
 in GStreamer signal-processing pipelines. Examples include an element
 to add simulated gravitational waves to an h(t) stream, and a source
 element to provide the contents of .gwf frame files to a GStreamer
 pipeline.
