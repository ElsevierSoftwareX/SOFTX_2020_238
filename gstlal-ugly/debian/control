Description: GStreamer version of LAL (ugly part)
 gstlal provides a suite of GStreamer elements that expose
 gravitational-wave data analysis tools from the LAL library for use
 in GStreamer signal-processing pipelines. Examples include an element
 to add simulated gravitational waves to an h(t) stream, and source
 elements that can provide data from .gwf frame files or NDS
 servers to a GStreamer pipeline.
