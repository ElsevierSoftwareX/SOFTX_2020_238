gstlal Installation Instructions
================================


.. contents:: Table of Contents


Overview
========

gstlal is a project that links together LAL and its associated libraries with 
GStreamer and so requires all of those tools to be installed, including the 
normally optional development-related components.  Once the dependencies are 
installed, the installation of gstlal itself should be very simple.



Preparing the Filesystem
========================

The following is the filesystem layout I (Kipp) use.  Of course other 
arrangements are possible, and you are welcome to experiment, but if you have 
problems please try this arrangement before reporting problems.

The top level directory is ``local/`` in which is found a normal collection of 
unix install directorys: ``bin/``, ``lib/``, etc..  The ``/path/to/local/`` will
be used as the install prefix for all software components.  Also in ``local/`` 
is a directory named ``src/``, and this is where we will keep the source code 
for the software.  For reference the tree looks like this, but do not try to 
make this by hand, it will be constructed for you as you download and install 
softare::

  local/
    bin/
    include/
    lib/
    ... and so on ...
    src/
      gst-plugins-bad/
      gst-plugins-base/
      gst-plugins-good/
      gst-python/
      gstlal/
      gstreamer/
      lalsuite/
        glue/
        lal/
        lalapps/
        lalburst/
        lalframe/
        lalmetaio/
        pylal/
        ... and so on ...

Prepare the filesystem by doing the following.  Choose where you want ``local/``
to go (I put it in my home directory, but you might prefer to be more organized 
than that), then in that directory type::

  $ mkdir local
  $ mkdir local/src

The rest of the tree will be created as software is downloaded and installed.



Preparing the Environment
=========================

Disable the system-wide lscsoft installation by doing::

  $ cd ${HOME}
  $ touch .nolscsoft

then, on Debian systems, manually re-enable libframe and libmetaio by adding::

  export PKG_CONFIG_PATH="/opt/lscsoft/libframe/lib/pkgconfig:${PKG_CONFIG_PATH}"
  export PKG_CONFIG_PATH="/opt/lscsoft/libmetaio/lib/pkgconfig:${PKG_CONFIG_PATH}"

to ``${HOME}/.bash_profile``, or wherever you set variables like this.  On 
RedHat derived systems like CentOS, use ``lib64/`` instead of ``lib/`` in these 
two paths.  Log out of your account and log back in again and confirm that 
``pkg-config`` returns the correct directories for these two libraries with::

  $ pkg-config --cflags libframe libmetaio -I/opt/lscsoft/libmetaio/include -I/opt/lscsoft/libframe/include


Debian **ONLY** Instructions
----------------------------

Skip this section **UNLESS** you are on a Debian system.

Now create the environment setup script for the software to be installed in your
home directory with::

  $ cd /path/to/local/
  $ cat >environment.sh <<_EOF_
  export PATH="/path/to/local/bin:\${PATH}"
  export PKG_CONFIG_PATH="/path/to/local/lib/pkgconfig:\${PKG_CONFIG_PATH}"
  export PYTHONPATH="/path/to/local/lib/python2.5/site-packages:\${PYTHONPATH}"
  _EOF_

If your system is older the ``python2.5`` part of the paths might need to be 
replaced with ``python2.4``, or if it's newer you might need to change it to 
``python2.6``.  So, take a look at your system and figure this out.

Once you have constructed ``environment.sh`` with those four environment variables in it::

  $ source /path/to/local/environment.sh

You will need to do this everytime you wish to use or do development work with 
the software.  It might make sense to put this in your login scripts (but 
remember you have done this, if you choose to).

Now continue to the section `Downloading and Installing Dependencies`_.


CentOS **ONLY** Instructions
----------------------------

Skip this section **UNLESS** you are on a CentOS or Red Hat system.

Now create the environment setup script for the software to be installed in your
home directory with::

  $ cd /path/to/local/
  $ cat >environment.sh <<_EOF_
  export PATH="/path/to/local/bin:\${PATH}"
  export PKG_CONFIG_PATH="/path/to/local/lib/pkgconfig:\${PKG_CONFIG_PATH}"
  export PYTHONPATH="/path/to/local/lib64/python2.4/site-packages:/path/to/local/lib/python2.4/site-packages:\${PYTHONPATH}"
  _EOF_

Once you have constructed ``environment.sh`` with those four environment variables in it::

  $ source /path/to/local/environment.sh

You will need to do this everytime you wish to use or do development work with 
the software.  It might make sense to put this in your login scripts (but 
remember you have done this, if you choose to).


Additional CentOS Dependencies
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

CentOS requires a few extra packages because GStreamer depends on newer versions
of GNU Autotools and the lexer 'flex'.  Before proceeding, you will need to 
install source releases of the following packages.

You can use the latest stable release for each of these, but for the sake of 
convenience we have added URL shortcuts to download versions that we have tested.

 * m4:        http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/m4/m4-1.4.14.tar.gz
 * autoconf:  http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/autoconf/autoconf-2.65.tar.gz
 * automake:  http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/automake/automake-1.11.tar.gz
 * gettext:   http://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/gettext/gettext-0.17.tar.gz
 * libtool:   http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/libtool/libtool-2.2.6b.tar.gz
 * flex:      http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/flex/flex-2.5.35.tar.gz?download
 * pkgconfig: http://pkgconfig.freedesktop.org/releases/pkg-config-0.23.tar.gz

Installing each of these **except** pkgconfig using the standard recipe:
download, extract, enter the directory, configure, and make install::
    
  $ cd /path/to/local/src
  $ wget *url*
  $ tar xzvf *tarball name*
  $ pushd *directory*
  $ ./configure --prefix=/path/to/local && make -j install
  $ popd

When you get to pkgconfig, follow a slightly modified recipe.  Although you need
to upprade pkgconfig in order to build GStreamer, you need your new pkgconfig
installation to pick up the system-level .pc path.  To do this, install
pkgconfig using the following incantation::

  $ cd /path/to/local/src
  $ wget http://pkgconfig.freedesktop.org/releases/pkg-config-0.23.tar.gz
  $ tar xzvf pkg-config-0.23.tar.gz
  $ pushd pkg-config-0.23
  $ ./configure --prefix=/path/to/local --with-pc-path=/usr/lib64/pkgconfig && make -j install
  $ popd

Now continue to the section `Downloading and Installing Dependencies`_.


Mac OS X **ONLY** Instructions
------------------------------

Skip this section **UNLESS** you are on a Mac OS X system.

Note: the Mac OS instructions are known to be incomplete; there may be some
MacPorts packages that are required but not listed.  If you discover this is
the case, please email <leo.singer@lig.org>.

Additional Mac OS X Dependencies
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The preferred method of getting Mac OS X build dependencies is MacPorts, a 
free, source-based package manager for Mac OS.

The following instructions assume that you have a fresh installation of Leopard
or Snow Leopard.  These instructions should work on most systems, except if you 
have another package manager (such as Fink) installed.

To install MacPorts, first install Xcode from the Developer CD that came with
your computer, or from the Mac OS developer site <http://developer.apple.com>.

Next, download the latest MacPorts release for your system from
<http://www.macports.org/install.php>.  Make sure that you select the installer
package (.pkg) that matches your operating system: Leopard or Snow Leopard.

Run the installer to set up the MacPorts package manager.  Then start a new shell.
To make sure that MacPorts is installed, run the following command::
   
   $ port help

You should not get an error message.  If you now have the Port command, proceed.

Now, we asre going to use MacPorts to get the prerequisites for GStreamer, 
lalsuite, and gstlal.  (Note: this is a partial list; I need to test the 
procedure on a fresh Mac box.)  Every time you see a command starting with
`sudo`, you may be prompted for your login password.  Run the following commands::
    
  $ sudo port install python26
  $ sudo port install python_select
  $ sudo python_select python26
  $ sudo port install wget fftw-3 fftw-3-single py26-numpy py26-scipy py26-matplotlib glib2 py26-gobject py26-gtk git-core gsl libframe metaio
 

Mac OS X Environment
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Now create the environment setup script for the software to be installed in your
home directory with::

  $ cd /path/to/local/
  $ cat >environment.sh <<_EOF_
  export PATH="/path/to/local/bin:\${PATH}"
  export PKG_CONFIG_PATH="/path/to/local/lib/pkgconfig:\$(python-config --prefix)/lib/pkgconfig:\${PKG_CONFIG_PATH}"
  export PYTHONPATH="/path/to/local/lib/python2.6/site-packages:\${PYTHONPATH}"
  _EOF_

Once you have constructed ``environment.sh`` with those four environment variables in it::

  $ source /path/to/local/environment.sh

You will need to do this everytime you wish to use or do development work with 
the software.  It might make sense to put this in your login scripts (but 
remember you have done this, if you choose to).

After you have set up your Mac OS X dependencies and your Mac OS X environment 
script, skip the section "Downloading and Installing Dependencies" and continue 
to the section `Downloading the Software`_.

.. NOTE:: When you reach the "gstlal Installation" step, configure GStreamer 
          with ``CFLAGS="-g"``.


Downloading and Installing Dependencies
=======================================

As we develop gstlal we sometimes find and fix bugs in and add new features to 
gstreamer itself.  Using gstlal requires a version of gstreamer that has our 
patches included, so in the instructions below we will be using the head of 
gstreamer's master branch, not an official source release (we do not expect to 
work this way in the long run, this is a start-up transient).  Because, for now,
we will be using the newest version of gstreamer available, some of the software
dependencies might be a little ahead of what is provided by your operating 
system.  Building gstreamer from git clone on Debian lenny (the current stable 
release, the OS found on the Atlas cluster) will require you to install

 * ≥glib-2.20.5.tar.gz
 * ≥pygobject-2.14.2.tar.gz
 * ≥pygtk-2.8.6.tar.gz

in your home directory.  The following instructions will download and install 
these three software packages into your ``/path/to/local`` prefix::

  $ cd /path/to/local/src
  $ wget http://ftp.gnome.org/pub/GNOME/sources/glib/2.20/glib-2.20.5.tar.gz
  $ wget http://ftp.gnome.org/pub/GNOME/sources/pygobject/2.14/pygobject-2.14.2.tar.gz
  $ wget http://ftp.gnome.org/pub/GNOME/sources/pygtk/2.8/pygtk-2.8.6.tar.gz
  $ tar -xzf glib-2.20.5.tar.gz
  $ pushd glib-2.20.5
  $ ./configure --prefix=/path/to/local && make install
  $ popd
  
  $ tar -xzf pygobject-2.14.2.tar.gz
  $ pushd pygobject-2.14.2
  $ ./configure --disable-glibtest --prefix=/path/to/local && make install
  $ popd
  
  $ tar -xzf pygtk-2.8.6.tar.gz
  $ pushd pygtk-2.8.6
  $ ./configure --disable-glibtest --prefix=/path/to/local && make install
  $ popd



(Optional) NDS Support
======================

gstlal includes an optional source element for retrieving live data from an NDS 
server. To enable NDS support, ensure that you have the NDS2 client installed 
before building gstlal. This requires you to install

 * ≥nds2-client-0.5.2.tar.gz

To support Kerberos authentication, you will need to make sure that your system 
has libsasl2 and the gssapi module for libsasl2. In Debian these are the packages

 * libsasl2-dev
 * libsasl2-modules-gssapi-mit

To install the NDS client library, run the following commands::

  $ wget http://ldas-jobs.ligo.caltech.edu/~jzweizig/nds2-release/nds2-client-0.5.2.tar.gz
  $ tar -xzf nds2-client-0.5.2.tar.gz
  $ pushd nds2-client-0.5.2
  $ ./configure --prefix=/path/to/local && make install
  $ popd



Downloading the Software
========================

The following will clone the GStreamer source trees giving you read-only access::

  $ cd /path/to/local/src/
  $ git clone git://anongit.freedesktop.org/git/gstreamer/gst-plugins-bad
  $ git clone git://anongit.freedesktop.org/git/gstreamer/gst-plugins-base
  $ git clone git://anongit.freedesktop.org/git/gstreamer/gst-plugins-good
  $ git clone git://anongit.freedesktop.org/git/gstreamer/gst-python
  $ git clone git://anongit.freedesktop.org/git/gstreamer/gstreamer

The following will clone the gstlal source tree giving you read-only access::

  $ cd /path/to/local/src/
  $ git clone git://ligo-vcs.phys.uwm.edu/gstlal.git

*OR*, those with ligo.org credentials can obtain a read-write clone of the 
gstlal source tree by using::

  $ cd /path/to/local/src/
  $ git clone ssh://albert.einstein@ligo-vcs.phys.uwm.edu/usr/local/git/gstlal.git

You must also clone lalsuite by following the instructions on the LAL project page.


Patching gst-plugins-base
=========================

To improve performance, some of the example pipelines provided with gstlal use 
an experimental patch that adds gap support to gstreamer's stock audioresample 
element.  We are in the process of preparing the patch for inclusion in the 
upstream source tree but the patch is not ready yet.  To use the programs 
included in gstlal you will need to apply the audioresample patch to your 
gst-plugins-base source tree locally::

  $ cd /path/to/local/src
  $ pushd gst-plugins-base
  $ wget https://www.lsc-group.phys.uwm.edu/daswg/projects/gstlal/audioresample.patch
  $ git apply audioresample.patch
  $ popd




Patching gst-plugins-bad
========================

Our pipelines get bitten by a long-standing bug in the glib library (166020).  
I have opened a new bug report with a patch to gst-plugins-bad to work around 
the problem (607513), but hopefully progress can be made on fixing the real 
problem in glib.  In the meantime, you need to apply the patch locally to 
eliminate some segfaults from the input-selector element.

The patch was briefly accepted into the main source tree but was found to 
create lock-ups in totem, the Gnome media player, and so because a release is 
pending the patch has been reverted.  git can be used to retrieve and re-apply 
the original patch locally to allow our pipelines to work::

  $ cd /path/to/local/src
  $ pushd gst-plugins-bad
  $ git cherry-pick 7e067615ffb5614f068f7753c10dde99afe49c3c
  $ popd



Installing the Software
=======================

 1. Change to your ``src`` directory::
    
    $ cd /path/to/local/src

 2. Install the components of lalsuite in the order glue, lal, lalframe, 
    lalmetaio, lalburst, lalinspiral, lalpulsar, lalstochastic, lalapps, 
    pylal, using:
    
    * ``$ pushd lalsuite``
    
      - For C components::
        
        $ pushd directory
        $ ./00boot && ./configure --prefix=/path/to/local && make -j install
        $ popd
      
      - For Python components::
        
        $ pushd directory
        $ python setup.py install --prefix=/path/to/local
        $ popd
      
    * ``$ popd``
      
    * *do not* set any environment variables except as instructed above,
    * *do not* source any "user-env" scripts.
 
 3. Install the components of gstreamer in the order gstreamer, 
    gst-plugins-base, gst-plugins-good, gst-plugins-bad, gst-python, using::
    
    $ pushd directory
    $ ./autogen.sh --noconfigure && ./configure --prefix=/path/to/local && make -j install
    $ popd
    
    .. NOTE:: Ignore warnings about "failed to install schema", these appear 
              to be harmless.
    
    .. NOTE:: Occasionally, a few of the libraries provided by ``gst-plugins-good``
              and ``gst-plugins-bad`` will fail to build because compiler warnings
              that occur on only certain (usually older) versions of gcc.

              The ``'<variable>' may be used uninitialized in this function`` warning
              appears to be highly dependent on compiler version.  If you have
              trouble building some of the GStreamer plugins, try setting the
              environment variable ``CFLAGS="-Wno-uninitialized"`` and re-running
              ``configure`` and ``make install``.
    
    .. IMPORTANT:: At configure time, ``gst-python`` needs to know the directory in
              which the Python shared library, libpython2.x, is installed on
              your system.  The rules it uses to locate libpython are known not
              to work perfectly on CentOS and Mac OS.  You can specify this
              directory explicitly, if necessary.
              
              If you are installing on a 64-bit CentOS machine (e.g., the CIT cluster),
              you must configure ``gst-python`` with::
              
                $ ./configure --prefix=/path/to/local --with-libpython-dir=/usr/lib64
             
             And if you are installing on a Mac and you want to use the Python
             interpreter that comes with MacPorts, you must configure ``gst-python``
             with::
             
               $ ./configure --prefix=/path/to/local --with-libpython-dir=/opt/local/lib
 
 4. Install gstlal with::
    
    $ pushd gstlal
    $ ./00init.sh && ./configure --prefix=/path/to/local && make -j install
    $ popd



Verifying the Installation
==========================

To check that each component is installed correctly, do the following.

.. NOTE::  Do not run these commands from inside any of the respective source 
           trees as the presence of files in those directories with names 
           matching those referred to in these commands will confuse the tests.

glue
----

  ::
  
  $ python -c "from glue import segments ; print segments.__file__"
  
  should not produce an error, and should print a filename located in the 
  ``/path/to/local/`` directory tree.


pylal
-----
  
  ::
  
  $ python -c "from pylal import datatypes ; print datatypes.__file__"
  
  should not produce an error, and should print a filename located in the 
  ``/path/to/local/`` directory tree, and::
  
  $ ldd /path/to/local/lib*/python*/site-packages/pylal/xlal/fft.so
  
  should not produce an error, and should show that ``liblal.so.0`` is provided by 
  a file located in the ``/path/to/local`` directory tree.


gstreamer
---------
  
  ::
  
  $ which gst-inspect
  
  should print ``/path/to/local/bin/gst-inspect``, and::
  
  $ gst-inspect coreelements
  
  should indicate that the Filename is in ``/path/to/local/lib/...`` .  To test for 
  the audioresampler's gap-aware patch::
  
  $ gst-inspect audioresample
  
  should list ``gap-aware`` under ``Element Properties``.


gstlal
------
  
  ::
  
  $ gst-inspect gstlal
  
  should report information on the gstlal plugin, showing a Filename in the 
  ``/path/to/local/lib/...`` tree, and there should be several elements provided
  by the plugin; and::
  
  $ ldd /path/to/local/lib/libgstlal.so
  
  should not produce an error, and should show that ``libgstbase-0.10.so.0``, 
  ``libgstreamer-0.10.so.0``, ``libgobject-2.0.so.0``, ``libgmodule-2.0.so.0``, 
  ``libgthread-2.0.so.0`` and ``libglib-2.0.so.0`` are all provided by files 
  located in the ``/path/to/local`` directory tree; and::
  
  $ python -c "from gstlal import pipeparts ; print pipeparts.__file__"
  
  should not produce an error, and should print a filename located in the 
  ``/path/to/local/`` directory tree.
