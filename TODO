General
=======

* Verify that all elements support discontinuities.
* Verify that all elements support gaps.
* Divide the gstlal_inspiral pipeline into reusable components, e.g. bins.
* Add the "restrict" keyword wherever possible in C code.


Plugins/elements to hand over to GStreamer
==========================================

* ``cairovis`` plugin
* ``unary`` plugin
* ``lal_gate`` element
* ``lal_reblock`` element
* ``lal_adder`` element: make the stock ``adder`` synchronous, or figure out how to use it
* ``lal_firbank`` element
* ``lal_matrixmixer`` element


``gstlal`` plugin
=================

* Add gap support to lal_whiten.
* Factor chi square calculation out of lal_triggergen.
* Backport the new time-symmetric trigger algorithm from s6online to master.
* Add support for partial coincidences (coincidences in which not all detectors
  participate) to lal_skymap.
* Come up with a trigger format that is less inspiral-centric so that all
  transient searches can share some common elements for trigger I/O, coincidence,
  and Bayesian localization.
* Add single-precision support to the following elements:

  * lal_firbank
  * lal_triggergen
  * lal_nxydump


``cairovis`` plugin
===================

* Add direct output to png, pdf, etc.
* Add timestamps to axes
* Add colorbar


Streaming with gstreamer
============================

* Figure out how to do live streaming thru web (pcdev1 or ATLAS) of a OmegaGram  movie
