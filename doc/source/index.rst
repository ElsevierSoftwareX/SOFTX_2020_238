The GstLAL project documentation
================================

`GstLAL` provides a suite of GStreamer elements that expose gravitational-wave data analysis tools from the LALSuite library for use in GStreamer signal-processing pipelines.

Examples include an element to add simulated gravitational waves to an h(t) stream, and a source element to provide the contents of .gwf frame files to a GStreamer pipeline.
