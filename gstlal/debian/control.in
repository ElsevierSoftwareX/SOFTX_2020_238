# FIXME:  gstreamer1.0-python3-plugin-loader is *in fact* a dependency, but
# it's not possible to have both our own legacy plugin loader and the stock
# loader installed in the gstreamer search path simultaneously, so we have
# this listed as a conflict.  note that this is just a safety check:  as
# soon as the package is actually available on the reference platform, we
# will switch to it, so in reality there will never really be an actual
# conflict.

Description: GStreamer for GW data analysis (core stable parts)
 This package provides a variety of GStreamer elements for
 gravitational-wave data analysis and some libraries to help write such
 elements.  The code here sits on top of several other libraries, notably
 the LIGO Algorithm Library (LAL), FFTW, the GNU scientific Library (GSL),
 and, of course, GStreamer.
 This package contains the plugins and shared libraries required to run
 gstlal-based applications.
